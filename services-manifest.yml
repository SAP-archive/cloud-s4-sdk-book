  # NOTE: You need to have installed the CF-Create-Service-Push CLI Plugin for this file to be considered.
  # You can find the plugin here: https://github.com/dawu415/CF-CLI-Create-Service-Push-Plugin
  # Usually installation is very easy. Just call 'cf install-plugin Create-Service-Push'.
  # Once installed, instead of calling 'cf push' call 'cf create-service-push'. This will inspect this file
  # create the services first and then call 'cf push' thus pushing your application as usual.
  # For more information please consult https://github.com/dawu415/CF-CLI-Create-Service-Push-Plugin/README.md
